# Clerk

A platform that helps find the right fit for a company.


## Used Commands
Navigate to the project directory then:
- Use `gulp` to run the project with live reloading using BrowserSync.
- Use `gulp del` to clear the build directory generated by gulp.
- Use `gulp release` to build a release version.


## Few other things
- We used `ES6 JavaScript` using `babel` and you can find all the JS files in the babel/ directory.
- We used pug to generate our html `pug/`, and we linked them together with JSON data `data/`.
- We used `stylus` together with `kouto-swiss` to generate our css files.
